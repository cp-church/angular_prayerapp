## Features

### 🙏 Prayer Management
- **Add Prayer Requests**: Create new prayer requests with titles, descriptions, categories, and requester information
- **Status Tracking**: Track prayers through various status stages (pending, approved, active, answered, closed)
- **Updates**: Add prayer updates to track progress and answered prayers
- **Pray For (Prayer Encouragement)**: Click “Pray For” on community prayers to encourage requesters; they see how many people have prayed (anonymous count). Admins can enable/disable the feature and set the cooldown (1–168 hours) in Admin settings. In **Settings**, users can hide the Pray For control and/or the praying-count chip on cards for their own view (`email_subscribers` prefs; see [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Categories**: Organize prayers by custom prayer types
- **Admin Approval**: Moderation system with approval workflow

### 📖 Memorize Scripture
- **Personal memorization**: Add Bible passages, **Bible Books** lists, or verses from admin-curated **Recommended** categories
- **Translations**: ESV (Crossway) plus **KJV, NASB, LSB, NIV, NLT, CSB** via API.Bible; **Listen** is ESV-only
- **Practice modes**: Type, Initials, Word, Reorder, and **Recite** (beta — record and compare via OpenAI Whisper when enabled by admin)
- **Mastery tracking**: Learning → Practicing → Mastered based on completed practice sessions
- **Strict mode**: Optional setting disables auto-reveal after wrong answers and requires a perfect round before advancing
- **Reminders**: Optional hourly memorization nudges (email and/or push), separate from prayer reminders
- See [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#memorize-esv--apibible) and [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for setup (ESV/API.Bible secrets, Recite mode ops)
