## Priority Recommendations

### 🔴 **CRITICAL Priority (Do Immediately)**
1. **Add tests for page components** - These are the primary user interfaces:
   - app.component.ts (0% coverage)
   - login.component.ts (0.82% coverage)
   - home.component.ts (1.48% coverage)
   - admin.component.ts (2.3% coverage)
   - presentation.component.ts (2.48% coverage)

2. **Test admin-auth.service.ts** - Critical authentication service with only 1.19% coverage

3. **Improve prayer-search.component.ts** - Large search component with 0.58% coverage

### 🟡 **HIGH Priority (Do Soon)**
1. **Increase prayer.service.ts coverage** - Core service at 42.12%
2. **Test large components:**
   - prayer-card.component.ts (9.16%)
   - backup-status.component.ts (1.11%)
   - email-subscribers.component.ts (0.84%)
   - email-templates-manager.component.ts (2.73%)

### 🟢 **MEDIUM Priority (Improvement)**
1. **Improve branch coverage** in otherwise well-tested modules:
   - email-notification.service.ts (47.58% branches)
   - admin-data.service.ts (64.02% branches)
   - supabase.service.ts (needs better error path testing)

## Coverage Trends & Goals

### Current State: 52.27% Line Coverage
- ✅ **Strengths:** Core utilities, types, and many components are excellently tested
- 🟡 **Moderate:** Service layer needs improvement
- 🔴 **Weaknesses:** Page components and some large components lack tests

### Recommended Coverage Goals

| Category | Current | Target | Timeline |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Overall Lines | 52.27% | 75%+ | 4-6 weeks |
| Services | 67.31% | 85%+ | 2-3 weeks |
| Components | ~50% | 70%+ | 3-4 weeks |
| Pages | <3% | 60%+ | URGENT |

### Path to 75% Coverage
1. **Week 1-2:** Add tests for all page components (app, home, login, admin, presentation)
2. **Week 2-3:** Complete service layer testing (admin-auth, prayer services)
3. **Week 3-4:** Test remaining large components (prayer-search, backup-status, etc.)
4. **Week 4-6:** Improve branch coverage and edge case testing
