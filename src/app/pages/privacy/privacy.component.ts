            <p>
              This Privacy Policy describes how the Prayer App ("we," "our," or
              "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you
              use our mobile and web application. The app is used by faith
              communities to manage prayer requests and stay connected. By using
              the app, you agree to this policy.

              2. Information We Collect
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">We collect the following types of information:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>
                <strong>Account and identity:</strong> Email address, name (or
                display name), and verification codes sent to your email for
                sign-in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prayer content:</strong> Prayer requests (who or what
                the prayer is for, details), updates you add, and whether you
                chose to make a request anonymous.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Preferences:</strong> Notification settings (email and
                push), theme preference, and default prayer view.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push notifications (mobile app):</strong> If you enable
                push notifications, we store a device token and your email so we
                can send you notifications. You can turn this off in Settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage:</strong> We record page views and last activity
                date (for logged-in users) to support basic analytics and
                activity tracking within the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Optional:</strong> If your organization uses Planning
                Center, we may link your app account to Planning Center for list
                mapping; that is configured by your administrators.

              </li>
              <li>Authenticate you and manage your account and preferences.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Improve the app (e.g., error reporting and usage analytics—see

            <p>
              Your prayer content and account information are stored in our
              database. Administrators of your organization (e.g., church staff)
              can access the data needed to run the app (approve prayers, manage
              subscribers, send notifications). Public prayers you submit (after
              approval) are visible to other logged-in users in your community.
              Personal prayers are visible only to you. We do not sell your
              personal information.

              <li>
                <strong>Email:</strong> Email notifications are sent via a

              <li>
                <strong>Push notifications:</strong> Delivered via Apple (APNs)

                <strong>Error and analytics:</strong> We may use PostHog for
                error reporting, product analytics, and session replay (e.g.,
