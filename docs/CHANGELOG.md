# Changelog

Major features and milestones for the Prayer App.

## [Current] - February 2026

### Help modal guided tour (driver.js) ✅
- **Creating Prayers** (`help_prayers`): one **Start guided tour** → [`startCreatingPrayersHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): community **Request** + form (`#prayer_for`, `#description`, `#tour-prayer-visibility`, `#tour-prayer-anonymous`) → close form → **Add Update** / inline update / optional anonymous / mark answered when available. **No** filter-tile steps—those are [`startFilteringHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts) under **Filtering Prayers**. **Skips** private-prayer creation (**Personal Prayers** tour). [`startNewPrayerRequestTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts), [`startPersonalPrayerTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts), [`startUpdatingPrayerTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts), and [`startManagingPrayerViewsTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts) remain for reuse or tests. [`defaultPersonalPrayer`](src/app/components/prayer-form/prayer-form.component.ts) on home when the **Personal** filter is active.
- **Filtering Prayers** (`help_filtering`): footer **Start guided tour** → [`startFilteringHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): section title/description, then **`#tour-filter-current`** with **Filter Options** copy, **`#tour-filter-answered`** (clause from overview text), **`#tour-filter-total`** + **Finding Archived Prayers** block, **`#tour-filter-prompts`** (Prompts clause), **`#tour-filter-personal`** + **Personal Prayers Filter** block, **`#tour-prayer-search`** + **Search Across All Filters**; [`FilteringHelpSectionTourHooks`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts) on [`HomeComponent`](src/app/pages/home/home.component.ts). Steps omit controls missing from the DOM.
- **Using Prayer Prompts** (`help_prompts`): one **Start guided tour** under the section topics → [`startPrayerPromptsTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **`#tour-filter-prompts`** (intro + **Show prompts**), then either **`#tour-prompt-type-filters`** + **`#tour-prompt-card-sample`** (first card) or **`#tour-prompt-empty-state`**, then **`#tour-btn-prayer-mode-*`** (Pray / presentation; mentions **Settings → Print Prompts**).
- **Prayer Encouragement (Pray For)** (`help_prayer_encouragement`): **Start guided tour** → [`startPrayerEncouragementTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **`#tour-filter-current`** (intro + **Show current**), optional **`#tour-prayer-pray-for`** on the first community card, then a **popover-only** step with more detail.
- **Searching Prayers** (`help_search`): **Start guided tour** → [`startSearchPrayersTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **`#tour-prayer-search`** on Home, then **popover-only** search tips (**Clear Search**, phrases, breadth of terms).
- **Personal Prayers** (`help_personal_prayers`): **Start guided tour** → [`startPersonalPrayersHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): hands-on flow—**Request** → form steps auto-filled (**Test Personal Prayer**, sample description, **Personal Prayer**, **Test Category**) → submit → **`#tour-walkthrough-personal-prayer-card`** → edit modal (**`#tour-personal-prayer-edit-modal`**) → **Add update** / textarea → **`#tour-personal-category-filters`** + filter to sample category → card **drag handle** → **delete** (removes sample prayer via API). Constants: `PERSONAL_PRAYER_WALKTHROUGH_*` in the tour service; [`PrayerFormComponent`](src/app/components/prayer-form/prayer-form.component.ts) walkthrough helpers. This is where **private** prayer creation is toured; **Creating Prayers** sticks to community flow + filters.
- **Prayer Presentation Mode** (`help_presentation`): **Start guided tour** runs [`startPresentationModePrayButtonPreludeTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts) on Home first—highlights header **Pray** (`tour-btn-prayer-mode-*`); **Next** stores `PRESENTATION_HELP_TOUR_SESSION_KEY` and navigates to **`/presentation`**. [`PresentationComponent`](src/app/pages/presentation/presentation.component.ts) runs [`startPresentationModeTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts) after load: toolbar, controls, settings walkthrough, then final step **Next** calls **`exitPresentation`** (return home), not only the exit button highlight.
- **Printing** (`help_printing`): **Start guided tour** → [`startPrintingHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): header **Settings** (`tour-btn-settings-*`), **Next** opens modal, then **`#tour-settings-print-buttons`**, **`#tour-settings-print-prayers`**, **`#tour-settings-print-prompts`**, **`#tour-settings-print-personal`**, tips popover, final **Next** closes Settings.
- **Email Subscription** (`help_email_subscription`): **Start guided tour** → [`startEmailSubscriptionHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **Settings** gear, **`#tour-settings-email-subscription`** (mass email toggle), popover on push vs direct mail, final **Next** closes Settings.
- **Prayer reminders** (`help_prayer_reminders`): **Start guided tour** → [`startPrayerRemindersHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **Settings** gear, **`#tour-settings-prayer-reminders`**, **`#tour-settings-prayer-reminder-controls`** (hour + **Add reminder**), tips popover, final **Next** closes Settings.
- **Feedback** (`help_feedback`): **Start guided tour** → [`startFeedbackHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **Settings** gear, **`#tour-settings-feedback-section`** (always; form or disabled note), **`#tour-settings-feedback-type`**, **`#tour-settings-feedback-details`** in [`GitHubFeedbackFormComponent`](src/app/components/github-feedback-form/github-feedback-form.component.ts) when enabled, tips popover, final **Next** closes Settings.
- **App Settings** (`help_settings`): **Start guided tour** → [`startAppSettingsHelpSectionTour`](src/app/services/help-driver-tour.service.ts): **Settings** gear, then top-to-bottom highlights—**`#tour-settings-print-buttons`**, **`#tour-settings-theme`**, **`#tour-settings-text-size`**, **`#tour-settings-email-subscription`**, **`#tour-settings-push-notifications`** (when shown), **`#tour-settings-badges`**, **`#tour-settings-prayer-encouragement`**, **`#tour-settings-default-view`**, **`#tour-settings-prayer-reminders`**, **`#tour-settings-feedback-section`**, popovers for footer/logout/delete, final **Next** closes Settings.
- Stable `help-block-{sectionId}-{index}` anchors; community tour targets `tour-btn-new-prayer-request-*`, `#prayer_for`, `#description`, `#tour-prayer-visibility`, `#tour-prayer-anonymous`.

### Church website URL (header logo link) ✅
- Optional **`admin_settings.church_website_url`**: admins set it in **App Branding**; cached with other branding (`BrandingService`, `branding_last_modified` trigger includes URL changes).
- Home header **`app-logo`**: when the URL is a valid `http:`/`https:` link, the logo image and text title/subtitle wrap in an external link (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- Migration: `20260327130000_church_website_url.sql`.

### Info Page (`/info`) ✅
- ✅ **Public landing/overview page at `/info`**
  - Hero with app icon, “Cross Pointe Prayer Community” title, and short description.
  - CTAs: Web App (with QR), App Store (with QR), Android (coming soon).
  - Interactive feature preview: mock header (Help, Settings, Pray, Request), filter tabs (Current, Answered, Total, Prompts, Personal), and sample cards with modals (badges, prompt categories, personal actions).
  - Theme toggle and light/dark support; uses BrandingService for optional church logo.
  - No auth required; linked from login (“Learn more about this app”) and support (“About the app”).

- ✅ **Implementation**
  - `src/app/pages/info/info.component.ts` (standalone, lazy-loaded).
  - Route added in `app.routes.ts`; documented in README.md, docs/README.md, and DEVELOPMENT.md (Public Routes, Info Page section).

### Push Notifications and Email/Push Preferences ✅
- ✅ **`receive_push` default false and set only when device token is registered**
  - New subscribers and existing rows default to `receive_push = false`. When the native app stores a device token (`PushNotificationService.storeDeviceToken()`), it sets `receive_push = true` for that subscriber. Users can turn push off in Settings.
  - Migration: `20260223_receive_push_default_false.sql` (default + backfill).

- ✅ **Separate email vs push preferences**
  - **`is_active`** = mass **email** only (new/approved prayers, updates). Turning off "email notifications" only stops bulk emails; direct emails (e.g. your prayer approved/denied) still go out.
  - **`receive_push`** = app **push** (enabled when the app is installed and a device token is registered).
  - **`receive_admin_push`** = admin-only push (independent of `is_active`). Migration: `20260221_admin_not_tied_to_is_active.sql`, `20260222_email_subscribers_receive_admin_push.sql`.

- ✅ **Push when admin approves prayer or update**
  - When an admin approves a **prayer**, the **requester** gets a push: "Prayer approved."
  - When an admin approves an **update**, the **update author** gets a push: "Update approved."
  - Implemented via `PushNotificationService.sendPushToEmails()` called from `AdminDataService.approvePrayer()` and `approveUpdate()`; tap handling for `prayer_approved` and `update_approved` in `app.component.ts` and `capacitor.service.ts`.

- ✅ **Documentation**
  - Capacitor docs under `docs/Capacitor/` (CAPACITOR_GETTING_STARTED, CAPACITOR_BACKEND_SETUP, CAPACITOR_SETUP, CAPACITOR_QUICKSTART) with full migration list and preference model. Main docs README links to Capacitor and describes email vs push preferences.

### Prayer Encouragement (Pray For) ✅
- ✅ **Community “Pray For” support**
  - Prayer cards show a “Pray For” button when the feature is enabled; users can record that they prayed for a request.
  - Requesters and admins see an anonymous count (e.g. “3 Praying”); who clicked is not shown.
  - Cooldown (1–168 hours, configurable in Admin) limits how often the same user can click Pray For on the same prayer.

- ✅ **Admin settings**
  - Admin → Prayer Encouragement: toggle “Enable Prayer Encouragement” and set “Cooldown (hours)” (1–168). Cooldown control only visible when the feature is on.
  - Stored in `admin_settings`: `prayer_encouragement_enabled`, `prayer_encouragement_cooldown_hours` (default 4).

- ✅ **Implementation**
  - `PrayerEncouragementService`: reads/caches enabled and cooldown from DB; `recordPrayedFor()`, count lookups.
  - `prayer-encouragement-settings` component for admin UI; `prayer-card` shows button, count, and optional explanation modal (“Do not show again” in localStorage, cleared on logout).
  - Database: `prayers.prayed_for_count`; migrations: `20260224_prayer_encouragement.sql`, `20260225_prayer_encouragement_cooldown_hours.sql`.

- ✅ **Documentation**
  - docs/README.md (Core Capabilities, Key Concepts); README.md (Prayer Management, Admin Portal); DEVELOPMENT.md (PrayerEncouragementService, Prayer Encouragement section). In-app Help includes “Prayer Encouragement (Pray For)” section.

- ✅ **Per-user visibility on cards (Settings)**
  - **Prayer encouragement on cards** in the main settings modal: users can keep or turn off the **Show “Pray For” button** and **Show “Praying #” button** options for their own view (defaults on). Does not disable Prayer Encouragement for the community; it only hides those controls or the count chip for that subscriber.
  - Stored on **`email_subscribers`**: `show_pray_for_button`, `show_praying_count` (both `boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`). Migration: `20260327120000_email_subscribers_prayer_encouragement_ui.sql`.
  - **`UserSessionService`** selects these fields in `loadUserSession`, maps them to `UserSessionData`, exposes `getShowPrayForButton$()` and `getShowPrayingCount$()`, and **`updateUserSession`** keeps the cache in sync when toggles save.
  - **`prayer-card`** gates the Pray For block and the N Praying chip with those observables in addition to `PrayerEncouragementService.getPrayerEncouragementEnabled$()`.
  - In-app **Help**: **App Settings** and **Prayer Encouragement (Pray For)** both document the two toggles (`help-content.service.ts`).

### Personal Prayer Sharing to Public Prayer Feature ✅
- ✅ Users can now share personal prayers to the public prayer list for community support
  - Share button on personal prayer cards (share icon)
  - Confirmation modal before sharing
  - Personal prayer copy remains in user's account for reference
  - Shared prayer becomes a new public prayer with "pending" approval status
  - Admin receives notification to review and approve/deny

- ✅ Seamless data copying workflow
  - All updates/comments from personal prayer copied to public version
  - Prayer metadata preserved (title, description, prayer_for, status)
  - Requester name from user session or extracted from email
  - Email address included for admin contact

- ✅ Service implementation
  - `PrayerService.sharePrayerForApproval()` method handles all logic
  - Creates new prayer in `prayers` table with `approval_status: 'pending'`
  - Copies all related prayer updates to new public prayer
  - Sends admin notification about new prayer request
  - Refreshes user's personal prayers list after successful share

- ✅ UI improvements
  - Prayer card component displays share button for personal prayers
  - Loading spinner during share operation
  - Success toast notification: "Prayer shared! It has been submitted for admin approval."
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Modal closes automatically on successful share

- ✅ Documentation
  - Added comprehensive feature guide to DEVELOPMENT.md (Core Services section)
  - Includes data flow, process steps, UI components, error handling
  - Database impact overview (prayers, prayer_updates, personal_prayers tables)
  - User experience flow diagram
  - Testing guidance and troubleshooting tips

### Logo Flash Optimization ✅
- ✅ Eliminated visual flash of text logo on page refresh
  - BrandingService now initializes during APP_INITIALIZER (before component tree renders)
  - Logo data cached in localStorage and loaded synchronously on app boot
  - Added lightweight metadata-only queries to check for logo updates
  - Only fetches full logo data from Supabase when admin changes branding
  - Browser preload hints improve image load timing
  - Backward-compatible with existing branding system (no breaking changes)

- ✅ Database optimization with migration
  - Added `branding_last_modified` column to `admin_settings` table
  - Automatic trigger tracks when branding fields actually change
  - Metadata-only queries (~3s timeout) prevent downloading large base64 blobs unnecessarily
  - Efficient cache invalidation strategy

- ✅ Performance improvements
  - Reduced unnecessary database queries (only when branding changes)
  - Faster subsequent page loads (logos loaded from cache)
  - Minimal bandwidth for unchanged logos (metadata check only)
  - Better perceived performance on slower connections

### Delete Account (Settings) ✅
- ✅ **Users can delete their account from the main site settings modal**
  - "Delete your account" option at the bottom of the settings panel (below the feedback section).
  - Opens a verification dialog with a warning that the action cannot be undone.
  - Two choices: **"Delete account but keep my prayers"** (removes only the account from `email_subscribers`; prayers remain so they can still be lifted up) or **"Delete my account and all my prayers"** (removes the user’s prayer_updates, prayers, personal_prayers, and email_subscribers row).
  - After either choice the user is signed out via existing logout flow and would need to be re-approved to use the app again.

- ✅ **Implementation**
  - `user-settings.component.ts`: custom verification modal (z-[60]), `deleteAccountKeepPrayers()`, `deleteAccountAndPrayers()` with correct delete order; error handling and loading state.
  - Help: App Settings section in `help-content.service.ts` includes "Delete your account" with description of the two options.
  - Unit tests in `user-settings.component.spec.ts` (dialog, keep-prayers path, delete-prayers path, cancel, errors, empty email) and `help-content.service.spec.ts` (settings section includes delete-account help).

### Text Size (Settings) ✅
- ✅ **Users can adjust on-screen text size from Settings**
  - Settings modal includes a "Text size" section with three options: **Default**, **Larger**, and **Largest**.
  - Choice is stored in localStorage and applied app-wide via a CSS custom property (`--text-scale`) on the document root; base font size scales with the selection for easier reading.
  - In-app Help includes a "Text size" entry under App Settings describing the options and that the preference is saved automatically.

- ✅ **Implementation**
  - `TextSizeService`: `getTextSize()`, `setTextSize(size)`; persists `textSize` in localStorage and updates `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--text-scale', …)`.
  - `src/styles.css`: `:root { --text-scale: 1 }`; `html { font-size: calc(16px * var(--text-scale, 1)) }`.
  - `user-settings.component.ts`: Text size UI (three buttons), `handleTextSizeChange()`, sync from service in `ngOnInit` and `ngOnChanges` when modal opens; unit tests for loading, syncing, and handling each size.
  - `help-content.service.ts`: "Text size" help block under `help_settings` (after Theme Options).

### Prayer reminders (hourly nudges) ✅
- ✅ **Optional personal reminders at the top of chosen clock hours**
  - In **Settings**, users can add one or more hours (0–23) in their **device time zone** to receive a short nudge to pray. Add/remove slots with the dropdown and **Add reminder** / **Remove**.
  - **Email**: Sent when **Email subscription** is on (`email_subscribers.is_active`), using template key **`user_hourly_prayer_reminder`** (`{{appLink}}` in Edge; align **`APP_URL`** with `environment.appUrl` in production).
  - **Push**: Sent when **push** is enabled and the device has a registered token (`receive_push` + `device_tokens`), same pattern as other user pushes.
  - If **both** email and push apply, the user may receive **both** at that hour. These reminders are **personal** and separate from **community** prayer-update reminders configured by admins for requesters.

- ✅ **Implementation**
  - **DB**: `user_prayer_hour_reminders` (IANA timezone + local wall hour per row); RPC `get_user_prayer_hour_reminders_due_now()` for hourly matching. Migration: `20260315120000_user_prayer_hour_reminders.sql`.
  - **Edge**: `supabase/functions/send-user-hourly-prayer-reminders/` — invoked hourly via **Supabase `pg_cron` + `pg_net`** (migration `20260316130000_schedule_user_hourly_prayer_reminders_cron.sql`), Vault secrets `project_url` + `service_role_key`. Replaces former GitHub Action workflow for this job. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
  - **App**: `UserPrayerReminderService` (stale-while-revalidate cache on session), `UserSessionService` fields `prayerHourReminders` / `prayerHourRemindersFetchedAt`; UI in `user-settings.component.ts`. Unit tests: `user-prayer-reminder.service.spec.ts`.
  - **Help**: Standalone section **`help_prayer_reminders`** (“Prayer reminders”) in `help-content.service.ts`, plus **“Prayer reminders (hourly nudges)”** under **App Settings** (above Feedback Form). See **DEVELOPMENT.md** (Settings + “User hourly prayer reminders”).

### Community prayer reminders (`send-prayer-reminders`) scheduling ✅
- ✅ **Daily Edge Function trigger moved from GitHub Actions to Supabase `pg_cron`**
  - Migration `20260317120000_schedule_send_prayer_reminders_cron.sql` registers job **`invoke-send-prayer-reminders`** (`0 10 * * *` UTC), POSTing to **`send-prayer-reminders`** via **`pg_net`**, using the same Vault secrets **`project_url`** + **`service_role_key`** as the hourly user reminders job.
  - Removed `.github/workflows/send-prayer-reminders.yml`. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) (Community prayer reminders) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) (Archiving Workflow).

### Device token cleanup (`cleanup-device-tokens`) scheduling ✅
- ✅ **Daily Edge Function trigger moved from GitHub Actions to Supabase `pg_cron`**
  - Migration `20260318120000_schedule_cleanup_device_tokens_cron.sql` registers job **`invoke-cleanup-device-tokens`** (`0 3 * * *` UTC), POSTing to **`cleanup-device-tokens`** via **`pg_net`**, using Vault **`project_url`** + **`service_role_key`**.
  - Removed `.github/workflows/cleanup-device-tokens.yml`. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) (Device token cleanup) and [Capacitor/CAPACITOR_BACKEND_SETUP.md](Capacitor/CAPACITOR_BACKEND_SETUP.md).
