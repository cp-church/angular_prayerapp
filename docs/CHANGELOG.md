# Changelog

Major features and milestones for the Prayer App.

## [Current] - February 2026

### Push Notifications and Email/Push Preferences ✅
- ✅ **`receive_push` default false and set only when device token is registered**
  - New subscribers and existing rows default to `receive_push = false`. When the native app stores a device token (`PushNotificationService.storeDeviceToken()`), it sets `receive_push = true` for that subscriber. Users can turn push off in Settings.
  - Migration: `20260223_receive_push_default_false.sql` (default + backfill).

- ✅ **Separate email vs push preferences**
  - **`is_active`** = mass **email** only (new/approved prayers, updates). Turning off "email notifications" only stops bulk emails; direct emails (e.g. your prayer approved/denied) still go out.
  - **`receive_push`** = app **push** (enabled when the app is installed and a device token is registered).
  - **`receive_admin_push`** = admin-only push (independent of `is_active`). Migration: `20260221_admin_not_tied_to_is_active.sql`, `20260222_email_subscribers_receive_admin_push.sql`.

- ✅ **Push when admin approves prayer or update**
  - When an admin approves a **prayer**, the **requester** gets a push: "Prayer approved."
  - When an admin approves an **update**, the **update author** gets a push: "Update approved."
  - Implemented via `PushNotificationService.sendPushToEmails()` called from `AdminDataService.approvePrayer()` and `approveUpdate()`; tap handling for `prayer_approved` and `update_approved` in `app.component.ts` and `capacitor.service.ts`.

- ✅ **Documentation**
  - Capacitor docs under `docs/Capacitor/` (CAPACITOR_GETTING_STARTED, CAPACITOR_BACKEND_SETUP, CAPACITOR_SETUP, CAPACITOR_QUICKSTART) with full migration list and preference model. Main docs README links to Capacitor and describes email vs push preferences.

### Personal Prayer Sharing to Public Prayer Feature ✅
- ✅ Users can now share personal prayers to the public prayer list for community support
  - Share button on personal prayer cards (share icon)
  - Confirmation modal before sharing
  - Personal prayer copy remains in user's account for reference
  - Shared prayer becomes a new public prayer with "pending" approval status
  - Admin receives notification to review and approve/deny

  - All updates/comments from personal prayer copied to public version
  - Prayer metadata preserved (title, description, prayer_for, status)
  - Requester name from user session or extracted from email
  - Email address included for admin contact

- ✅ Service implementation
  - `PrayerService.sharePrayerForApproval()` method handles all logic
  - Creates new prayer in `prayers` table with `approval_status: 'pending'`

### Logo Flash Optimization ✅
- ✅ Eliminated visual flash of text logo on page refresh
  - BrandingService now initializes during APP_INITIALIZER (before component tree renders)
  - Logo data cached in localStorage and loaded synchronously on app boot
  - Added lightweight metadata-only queries to check for logo updates
  - Only fetches full logo data from Supabase when admin changes branding
  - Browser preload hints improve image load timing
  - Backward-compatible with existing branding system (no breaking changes)

- ✅ Database optimization with migration
  - Added `branding_last_modified` column to `admin_settings` table
  - Automatic trigger tracks when branding fields actually change
  - Metadata-only queries (~3s timeout) prevent downloading large base64 blobs unnecessarily
  - Efficient cache invalidation strategy

- ✅ Performance improvements
  - Reduced unnecessary database queries (only when branding changes)
  - Faster subsequent page loads (logos loaded from cache)
  - Minimal bandwidth for unchanged logos (metadata check only)
  - Better perceived performance on slower connections
