## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Prayer States
- **Pending**: Awaiting admin approval
- **Approved**: Visible to all users
- **Denied**: Rejected by admin (user notified via email)
- **Answered**: Prayer was answered (user marks it)

### User Roles
- **Anonymous**: Can submit prayer requests only
- **Authenticated**: Can submit, update, manage prayers
- **Admin**: Can approve/deny, manage settings

### Email and Push Notifications
- **Email:** Built on Microsoft 365 Graph API; queue-based processing; HTML templates; subscriber management. **`is_active`** on `email_subscribers` controls whether a user receives **mass email** (new/approved prayers, updates). Turning off "email notifications" only stops those bulk emails; direct emails (e.g. your prayer approved/denied) still go out.
- **Push (native app):** Controlled by **`receive_push`** on `email_subscribers`. Push is set to `true` only when the user installs the app and a device token is registered; default is `false`. Admins have a separate **`receive_admin_push`** for admin alerts. See [Capacitor docs](Capacitor/CAPACITOR_BACKEND_SETUP.md) for setup. When an admin approves a prayer or update, the requester/author receives a push notification if they have push enabled.

### Prayer Encouragement (Pray For)
When enabled by an admin, community prayer cards show a **“Pray For”** button. Users can tap it to record that they prayed for that request; the count is shown to the person who submitted the prayer and to admins (who clicked is anonymous). A **cooldown** (configurable in Admin → Prayer Encouragement, 1–168 hours) limits how often the same user can click Pray For on the same prayer. Settings are stored in **`admin_settings`** (`prayer_encouragement_enabled`, `prayer_encouragement_cooldown_hours`) and cached in the app. The in-app **Help & Guidance** modal includes a “Prayer Encouragement (Pray For)” section for users.
