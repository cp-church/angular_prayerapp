### User Roles
- **Anonymous**: Can submit prayer requests only
- **Authenticated**: Can submit, update, manage prayers
- **Admin**: Can approve/deny, manage settings

### Email System
- Built on Microsoft 365 Graph API
- Queue-based processing (prevent rate limits)
- HTML templates with variable substitution
- Subscriber management (opt-in/out)

### PWA Features
- Service worker caching (prayers, assets)
